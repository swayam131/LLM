Enhancer Generator for a Specific Gene Using LangChain and Streamlit

Overview

This repository provides a pipeline for generating gene-specific enhancers using LangChain and Streamlit. The workflow is divided into two main components:

Langchain-initial.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook for initial model training and data preparation.

Application Scripts:

Langchain_helper.py: Helper functions and utilities for LangChain integration.

main.py: The main application script for running the Streamlit-based interface.

Features

Leverages LangChain for language model integration.

Provides a user-friendly interface via Streamlit.

Supports custom Python environments for seamless execution.

Setup and Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or above

A compatible virtual environment manager (e.g., venv, conda)

Required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt

Installation Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/enhancer-generator.git
cd enhancer-generator

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed for running the training notebook:

pip install notebook

Usage

1. Initial Training

Run the Langchain-initial.ipynb notebook to:

Prepare the dataset.

Train the language model.

Steps:

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
